Provides a way of iterating over an object without having to expose the objectâ€™s internal structure, which may change in the future. Changing the internals of an object should not affect its consumers.

## When to Use

When your collection possesses a complex internal data structure, or a data structure that is likely to change, so that clients can iterate over the collection without any knowledge of the data structure.

## Pros and Cons

- PRO: Satisfies SRP: traversal logic is abstracted into separate classes.
- PRO: Satisfied Open/closed principle: you can create new collections and iterators
  without breaking the code that uses them.
- CON: Can be overengineering if your app only works with simple collections.

## In Practice

### Bad Example

This is problematic because what if shopping list was a fixed array instead? Or if the list requires fixed values inside of it?

```cs
ShoppingList shoppingList = new ShoppingList();
shoppingList.Push("Milk");
shoppingList.Push("Bread");
shoppingList.Push("Steak");

for (int i = 0; i < shoppingList.GetList().Count; i++)
{
    var item = shoppingList.GetList()[i];
    System.Console.WriteLine(item);
}
```

### Good Example

Delegate iteration to another method/class that exists within the object. This fixes the single responsibility violation.

```cs
ShoppingList shoppingList = new ShoppingList();
shoppingList.Push("Milk");
shoppingList.Push("Bread");
shoppingList.Push("Steak");

IIterator<string> iterator = shoppingList.CreateIterator();

while (iterator.HasNext())
{
    System.Console.WriteLine(iterator.Current());
    iterator.Next();
}
```
